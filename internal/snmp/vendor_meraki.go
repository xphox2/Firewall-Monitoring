package snmp

// MerakiProfile is the SNMP profile for Cisco Meraki MX / Z / MS devices —
// untested on real hardware, built from vendor docs. Meraki has two SNMP
// flavours: cloud SNMP (polling the Dashboard with MERAKI-CLOUD-CONTROLLER-MIB,
// which cannot be polled from the devices) and device-local SNMP, which is
// SNMPv2-MIB + IF-MIB on the appliance's LAN IP. The collector polls the
// device, so only the local flavour applies, and that is the standards-only
// GenericProfile surface: this profile is a registered clone of it under its
// own name. A device tagged `meraki` polls the MIB-II scalars and interface
// tables, keeps its vendor for rules, capability profiles and the device form,
// and gains a cloud-MIB mapping here if one is ever verified.
